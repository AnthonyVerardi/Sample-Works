    "\n",
    "The data from the ALC were collected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and 2013, featuring both written and spoken responses to one of two prompt genres: \n",
    "* a **narrative** detailing their favorite vacation ever taken\n",
    "* a **discussion** of their academic plan of study\n",
    "\n",
    "All 942 participants were learners of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), although nearly half of all responses collected come from L1 Arabic speakers of a local dialect (790 out of 1,585 total responses). The other half of the participants come from a variety of language and geopolitical backgrounds. The full dataset includes the raw text in Arabic of each participant's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified dataset that I'm using for this analysis only contains a portion of the metadata columns that the original had to offer and does not include the full text responses (exporting from Python to a .csv proved problematic for preserving Arabic-language texts). In detail, the 16 columns used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'Participant': a unique participant identifier starting with S and followed by 3 digits; truncated from the original system\n",
    "* 'TestNumber': the number of the test represented by the specific observation of data from a given participant. TestNumber of 2 indicates that this is the participant's *second test recorded,* for example. Ranges from 1-5.\n",
    "* 'L1': the first language of the participant\n",
    "* 'L1family': the broader language family to which the participant's L1 belongs\n",
    "* 'NumLangs': the number of languages known by the participant, ranging from 1-10\n",
    "* 'Nationality': the nationality of the participant, 67 nationalities represented\n",
    "* 'Age': the age of the participant, ranges from 16-42\n",
    "* 'Gender': the gender of the participant, here only given as \"Female\" or \"Male\"\n",
    "* 'YearsStudy': how many years the participant has studied MSA, ranges from 0-19\n",
    "* 'GenLvl': whether the participant is pre or post-university in their studies\n",
    "* 'LvlStdy': whether the participant is in a BA program, MA program, diploma course, language school, or secondary school\n",
    "* 'Genre': the genre of the text as mentioned above, either narrative or discussion\n",
    "* 'Mode': whether the text was recorded as writing or speech\n",
    "* 'TextLen': the length of the text in words (*not* morphological units)\n",
    "* 'TitleLen': the length of the text's title in words (*not* morphological units)\n",
    "* 'TTR': the type/token ratio found in the text, i.e. the ratio of unique word **types** to total number of word **tokens**"

    "\n",
    "The current work aims to explore one research question, namely: does **genre of response prompt** (narrative or discussion) have a statistically significant effect on **text length** in this dataset? Intuitively, one might expect that participants would produce lenghtier responses when asked about their favorite vacation as opposed to their plans of study, which they might not have as much to say about. Conversely, it may also be that \"plan of study\"-discussion responses will be longer because the act of talking about oneself in the active, present tense is generally thought of in language pedagogy as a \"lower-proficiency\" task (ex. ACTFL, CEFR guidelines) compared to past-tense narration. In either case, it stands to reason that the genre of task used to collect a response may have an effect on its length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way that I'll try to explore this question is by using a **Chi-Squared test,** and the second one is by using a **Mixed-Effects Linear Regression model.** The Chi-Squared test will rely on text length data that have been collapsed into \"short\", \"medium\", and \"long\" categorical groups, while the Mixed-Effects model will use the raw text length.\n",

    "For the Chi-Squared test, I predict that the genre of the response will have a statistically significant effect on the length of the response, and that on average, we will see larger counts of longer texts than predicted for texts in the \"narrative\" genre category and shorter texts patterning with the \"discussion\" category. A Chi-Squared test is appropriate here since we're dealing with two types of categorical variable (Genre: \"narrative\" vs. \"discussion\" and length: \"short\", \"medium\", \"long\") that have count data in each cell, and it is unclear as to whether the levels of genre are independent from the levels of length. In summation, I predict that the proportion of responses observed will vary from the estimated levels by genre, that the variables of \"genre\" and \"length\" are associated with one another, and that narrative genre responses imply longer response texts.\n",

    "For the Mixed-Effects Linear Regression model, I predict the same as I did for the Chi-Squared test: that the genre of the response will have a statistically significant effect on the length of the response, and that on average, we will see larger counts of longer texts than predicted for texts in the \"narrative\" genre category and shorter texts patterning with the \"discussion\" category. However, I will additionally include level of study (\"LvlStdy\") as a fixed effect as well, assuming that this may also affect text length (assuming that the higher a person's degree progress/level of education and hence their familiarity with the target language, the longer their response will likely be). Mixed-Effects modeling makes sense here because it will allow me to use the raw counts from my data instead of the categorical groups of \"short\", \"medium\", and \"long\" that were created for the Chi-Squared test; further, a Mixed-Effects model makes sense given that each row in the table represents one \"trial\" by a given participant, not some type of average across all trials or participants. This will remove a source of bias on my part in choosing what qualifies as a \"short/medium/long\" response. For this test, I will use \"Genre\" and \"LvlStudy\" as fixed effects (since there are discrete possible levels for both) and introduce a random effect of \"Participant\" into the model to account for individual variation.\n",

    "### 3A. Meeting Assumptions <a name=\"MA1\"></a>\n",
    "As Levshina points out, there are only two assumptions that must be met in order to perform a Chi-Squared test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sample is *randomly selected from the population of interest* and *the observations are independent.* \n",
    "2. Every observation can be classiied into exactly one category according to the criterion represented by each variable (Conover 1999: 204–205).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second assumption provides no issue; each category is sufficiently different such that no response could go in either category. But the first assumption does actually pose a challenge: since our samples can be grouped by participant (some participants performed more than one test), we will have to account for that. I will do so by utilizing a subset of the corpus that only includes each participant's first test as a way of controlling for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "~After subsetting the data, another issue becomes apparent: one of the cells (Discussion:long) only has two observations recorded, which is below the 5-observation threshold for using a Chi-Squared test. Instead, I'll use a **Fisher's Exact Test**, although to save time on editing this notebook, I will continue to refer to this section as Chi-Squared.~\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking a moment to actually run both tests, it seems that using Chi-Squared as the actual test her may be a valid move. Unlike in Levshina's example on p.  213, running the Chi-Squared test on the subsetted data did not provide me with a warning message that the approximation may be incorrect. [This piece](https://towardsdatascience.com/fishers-exact-test-in-r-independence-test-for-a-small-sample-56965db48e87) also seems to indicate that the expected count cannot be lower than 5, but the observed counts may be.\n",

    "From comparing the output of the observed distribution of our categorical text length data against the expected values, we can see that there is some fluctuation between the two, but it seems to be relatively minor except for in the discussion:long cell (~9 expected, 2 observed). The actual Chi-Squared statistic is 6.3166, which does not seem to be \"large\" enough to safely conclude that there are large differences between actual and expected counts beyond what chance might give us. With a *p*-value of only .0425, a weakly significant relationship does exist, but I do not think I would risk my reputation on these results when making a claim. If standardized Pearson residual values above |1.96| are typically considered \"significant\" here and the \"discussion:long\" residual is only -2.476, and the overall *p*-value is .0425, it doesn't seem that genre is having a very strong or reliable effect at all, and this is the categorical relationship that seems to be contributing the most to our overall results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary: the variables \"Genre\" and \"Text Length\" are **not** independent, although the relationship between them is of weak significance (p <= .05) and the effect of genre on length seems most apparent and most impactful in the interaction between \"discussion\" prompts and \"long\" response lengths; discussion prompts do seem to weakly disfavor longer essays. All of the counts for discussion are actually lower than their expected values, but only \"long\" seems statistically significant; in other words, the initial hypothesis that narrative genre types would favor longer essays is cautiously correct at best (the evidence suggests that more testing may be necessary, and that other factors besides genre may be playing a role here) and may not hold up well under a different test (which may be (dis)proven in the next section by using a Mixed-Effects model)."

    "## 4. Mixed-Effects Linear Regression <a name=\"MER\"></a>\n",
    "### 4A. Meeting Assumptions <a name=\"MA2\"></a>\n",
    "Since linear regression includes a number of assumptions that must be met, I'll be briefly detailing each of them here in a bullet point and then showing any necessary proofs below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observations are independent\n",
    "    * Observations may be grouped by participant, but this has been accounted for as a random effect\n",
    "1. Response variable is interval-or ratio-scaled\n",
    "    * Yes, the response variable (TextLen) is ratio scaled; a response length of 0 is still meaningful as a non-reponse\n",
    "1. Relationship between variables is (roughly) linear\n",
    "    * Difficult to tell from the box plots alone since we're not working with categories that increase or decrease; both level of study and genre are discrete and can't really support \"linear\" modeling in the usual sense on their own\n",
    "1. Homoscedasticity of variance\n",
    "    * The variance seems heteroscedastic based on the linear model alone without random effects or interaction terms. See below \n",
    "    * Seems like the model has trouble with the higher end (right-side) of the fitted values\n",
    "1. Explanatory variables are not strongly correlated\n",
    "    * This at least should be fine; there is nothing intuitive to suggest that someone's level of academic study should impact which genre they are given for an experiment \n",
    "1. Residuals are not autocorrelated\n",
    "    * Likely not, since this is not time series data; no observation should have an impact on another one\n",
    "1. Residuals are normally distributed, with a mean of 0\n",
    "    * Not true, and log transforming the entire model doesn't seem to help very much (the other tail dips); then again, closer on the whole\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, all things being said and done, I do not think I would be the first person to violate these assumptions and still go ahead with their analysis, and I certainly will not be the last. We have discussed numerous times in class that researchers routinely use Mixed-Effects models for their robustness and seeming robustness in the face of violated assumptions. For the sake of learning, I plan to continue on with trying to fit a Mixed-Effects model to these data."

    "It does look like genre has some role to play for participants in BA programs and Secondary school; in general, we see the same pattern of longer responses on average for narrative data that the Chi-Squared test only hinted at. The distribution for MA-level participants is intriguing in its wide variance for the discussion genre; people at the graduate education level may be better-equipped and more willing to talk about their studies, perhaps. I would love to visualize this model by participants, but since there are 900+ people represented here, it didn't seem like a great idea."

    "Aside from dubious validity on the grounds of violated assumptions, this went well! Every step of adding a new parameter or modifying an existing one resulted in an increase of log likelihood, meaning that each predictor seems to be giving us some additional explanatory power when building our model. However, the scaled residuals of the final model (regr3) are skewed, ranging from -3.52 to 6.14, with a median of -0.0880. In the grand scheme of things, this actually doesn’t seem terrible; although the far ends are skewed, the median is still fairly close to 0. Returning to my hypothesis, it does seem that genre is more clearly having an effect once the full dataset can be utilized and random effects can be considered by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the fixed effects selected for our model, I take the increase in log likelihood when switching from “Genre + LvlStdy” to “Genre * LvlStdy” as confirmation that there is indeed some interaction between them to account for in our model. Since as a rule of thumb we can take as significant any predictor with an absolute *t*-value greater than two, it looks like the “narrative” genre on its own does indeed have a significant effect on text length; its *t*-value being 8.062. Also unsurprising here is the significance of all of the levels of study interacting with “Narrative” genre, except for secondary school. It makes some intuitive sense to me that a person’s level of education would impact the length of their writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a final note, I tried to include random by-Participant slopes for the effect of TestNumber to account for the fact that different people will perform different for different tests, but this produced an error (not a non-convergence error, just the regular kind). For me, I think Mixed-Effects models are going to take a lot of getting used to; although very robust and very powerful, I will admit to being intimidated by the sheer number of factors to consider when building one. But I suppose that’s part and parcel for working with data! \n",
