    "\n",
    "So, setup! Can't play with a fancy new toy if we don't have it, so we'll need to install Anaconda. This will also include Python and a whole slew of other neat gadgets. This is a shameless plug for both **LING 1330/2330 Computational Linguistics** and **LING 1340/2340 Data Science for Linguists** (which are both awesome and you should all consider taking them).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Installing Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda <a name=\"installanaconda\"></a>\n",
    "The absolute first thing you will need to do in order to start using Jupyter Notebook is [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), the self-proclaimed \"World's Most Popular Data Science Platform.\" Anaconda is freely available for download and open usage; simply follow the instructions from the homepage under \"Individual Edition\". You should go ahead and install the Python 3.7 version, which at the time of my writing this is the most recent version of Python. **If you end up taking a course at Pitt which requires a different installation configuration, ask your instructor about uninstalling Anaconda and getting the right version!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Creating an R Environment for Jupyter Notebook <a name=\"renv\"></a>\n",
    "This sounds scarier and more difficult than it really is! It's mostly just clicking some buttons and waiting for your computer to do its thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've got Anaconda successfully installed, go ahead and boot up \"Anaconda Navigator\". You can follow [this guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/\n",
    ") for the most straightforward way that I was able to find for getting R ready to use with Jupyter Notebook (I used this guide myself). Once you create your R environment (it'll take a while to set up all the base packages!), **close the navigator and restart it,** then try to open a Jupyter Notebook from that environment using the \"play\" button and selecting the last option in the list. From here, you can select \"New\" -> \"Jupyter Notebook\" to make a blank notebook in whatever directory you want to work in. Much like using R and setting a working directory, the Jupyter Notebook will use whatever directory you save it in as its current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a point of full disclosure,** I'm not going to go into detail about how to download new packages for R (like if we needed to download Rling for the first time, or any of the other packages we've used in class) while you're working in Jupyter Notebook. When I set up R, all of the packages that I already had for R seemed to be working just fine, so it might just be the case that you need to install packages in R and then fire up Jupyter Notebook after the fact. This will take some more research (and honestly just trial and error) than I'm capable of right now. With that said, on to actually working in Jupyter Notebook!\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Code Cells <a name=\"codecells\"></a>\n",
    "Code cells are the *bread* of Jupyter Notebook: the substance. Think of them like you would think of a regular script in R: a space for you to write code and comments. By default, a new cell is generated as a code cell when you click the `+` button in the user interface. To change a cell from `Code` to `Markdown`, just use the dropdown menu at the top of the Notebook. Besides actually running code in a code cell, you can include the usual comments that you would in an R script by using `#`, like so:"

But I guess in some ways, silence is a meaningful speech act, so it could possibly be ratio...? In  any case, it's definitely one of the two and not ordinal!

I'm going to stick with a `Kendall` test out of an abundance of caution, but it doesn't seem terribly egregious to use `Pearson's r` here instead. I'm electing to use `Kendall's tau` over `Spearman's rho` since the book notes that it can handle ties more adeptly, and multiple observations of data share value for phonological length."

In any case, the main takeaway is that there is a weak but significant correlation between phonological length and word duration in seconds, which makes intuitive sense: the longer a word in phonemes (or maybe really articulatory gestures?), the longer it should theoretically take to say it in most cases.\n",

    "## Section 4: Conclusion <a name=\"conclusion\"></a>\n",
    "As a parting consideration, I'm going to outline below what I think are the pros and cons behind working in Jupyter Notebook. I hope you've found this guide useful, and if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at the email listed above! Happy coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Why use R in Jupyter Notebook? <a name=\"pros\"></a>\n",
    "* Presentation, presentation, presentation! Jupyter Notebook is sleek, stylish, and industry standard for professional data science. It's much easier on the eyes than sifting through an R script.\n",
    "* Better presentation means easier sharability, which I'll cover below. This makes it easier to distribute your code and let people try to replicate your findings.\n",
    "* On a similar note, the ability to use Markdown cells for organization within a Notebook means that a reader can very easily orient themselves in a well-structured document. Whether this reader is your future self or anyone who reviews your work, this means that they'll have an easier time of understanding your thought process.\n",
    "* The coding itself is exactly the same and the output is exactly the same; there's little learning curve beyond what you already know once you have it set up. The biggest thing to adapt to is working with markdown cells, which should quickly become intuitive with practice.\n",
    "* Very easy to copy/paste code into Jupyter Notebook after having worked on it in R Studio or base R. In fact, I did this for the demonstration without having to alter any of my code (besides adding markdown and deleting extraneous `#` symbols!\n",
    "* Once you get into a groove of working with markdown and code cells in tandem, it's much easier to document what your code/script is doing than using `#comments` in R Studio or base R.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Why use R in Rstudio or as a Standalone Application? <a name=\"cons\"></a>\n",
    "* More direct support through the graphical user interface (GUI) like menus, pop-up windows, etc.\n",
    "    * IN essence, it's more beginner-friendly without adding the extra hurdle of working in a new environment with lots of bells and whisles.\n",
    "    * May accordingly be more difficult to install packages; you have to do it manually via CRAN, might need to move some files around, etc.\n",
    "* Doesn’t save your R environment (variables, loaded packages, models, etc.) as far as I know; you have to manuall re-run your code to get back up to speed once you close the Notebook.\n",
    "    * On the plus side, the code will never disappear unless you delete it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Exporting the Final Product <a name=\"export\"></a>\n",
    "The easiest way to share a Jupyter Notebook for people who don't have Anaconda installed is to export it as a `.html` file in the `File` menu, selected `Download As` and save it, and send it wherever you need to. A recipient should then be able to open it with their browser of choice. They won't be able to run the code themselves, but it's fully copy/paste-able! Case in point, this Notebook will be saved and shared as a `.html` file.\n",
